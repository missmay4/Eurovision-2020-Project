       The Eurovision Song Contest 2020 was planned to be the 65th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. 
       The contest would have taken place in Rotterdam, Netherlands, following the country's victory at the 2019 contest in Tel Aviv, Israel, with the song "Arcade" performed by Duncan Laurence.
        It would have been the fifth time that the Netherlands hosted the contest, the last time having been the 1980 contest. It was due to be held at Rotterdam Ahoy.
        The contest was cancelled on 18 March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the first time in the contest's 64-year history that it has been cancelled.

      It was scheduled to consist of two semifinals on 12 and 14 May, and a final on 16 May 2020.
      Forty-one countries would have participated in the contest; Bulgaria and Ukraine would have returned after their absences from the 2019 contest, while Hungary and Montenegro had confirmed their non-participation after taking part in the previous edition. 
      All forty-one competing artists and songs were confirmed by the relevant broadcasters by early March 2020.

      Following its cancellation, the European Broadcasting Union began discussions of potential carryovers for the 2021 contest, such as host city and participating artists, with various parties.
      In place of the cancelled contest, the EBU and its Dutch members NPO, NOS and AVROTROS organised a replacement show, Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, to showcase the selected entries in place of the Grand Final on 16 May.
      Rotterdam would later remain as the host city of the next year's contest.

      Rotterdam is a city and municipality in the Netherlands. It is in the province of South Holland, at the mouth of the Nieuwe Maas channel leading into the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta at the North Sea.
       Its history goes back to 1270, when a dam was constructed in the Rotte. In 1340, Rotterdam was granted city rights by the Count of Holland.
       The Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area, with a population of approximately 2.7 million, is the 13th-largest in the European Union and the most populous in the country.

    The Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt give waterway access into the heart of Western Europe, including the highly industrialized Ruhr. 
    The extensive distribution system including rail, roads, and waterways have earned Rotterdam the nicknames "Gateway to Europe" and "Gateway to the World".
